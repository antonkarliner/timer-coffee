New:
• Sometimes coffee bean bag is already finished, but there are a few grams still "remaining" in app inventiory. Bean Details screen now has "Set to zero" button which allows to quickly deal with this.
Improved: 
• Improved translation to Japanese, thanks @llibra!
• Added confirmation before sign out.
• Under the hood improvements which will make app more stable (hopefully!). 
Bugfix: 
• re-added missing error messages for Google Sign-in.
