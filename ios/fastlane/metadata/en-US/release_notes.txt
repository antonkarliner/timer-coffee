Meet Timer.Coffee 2.0!

I’ve made a ton of internal changes that have allowed me to introduce some cool new features, such as:
- Updating the recipes without needing to update the entire app. 
- Brew Diary, which allows you to track your brews, add notes, and more.
- 5 new languages added: Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Romanian and Ukrainian.

This is just the beginning — more awesome updates are on the way! Thank you for being a part of this journey. 

Version 2.0.1 fixes a little bug related to loading the steps for recipe in a correct order. Tnahks @robertkb for pointing it out!
