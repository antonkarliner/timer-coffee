New:
• Added new brewing methods for your custom recipes! Timer.Coffee now supports the April Brewer, Ceado Hoop Brewer, and Oxo Rapid Brewer.  
• Notification toggle: you can now enable or disable notifications in Settings.  
• It’s now possible to delete imported recipes from the Recipe Management screen.

Improved:  
• Completely reengineered the notifications system. Most changes happen behind the scenes, but notifications should now be more stable and less reliant on third-party solutions.  
• Slightly adjusted colors in dark mode for a look that better matches the app’s overall design.

Bugfix:  
• A previous fix for User Stats sync created an additional issue. Now, everything’s resolved. Important: some previously deleted brew diary entries may have been restored—sorry about that!  
• Global totals for coffee brewed are now displayed accurately.  
• Fixed an issue where navigating back from the coffee beans editing screen wouldn’t work if no changes had been made.
