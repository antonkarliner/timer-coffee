## Localization

If you want to improve the localization for the language, you can find translated interface files under lib/l10n/ and translated recipe files under assets/data/[locale]. Feel free to submit a PR, please also explain the reason for the correction.

If you want to add a new localization, you need to the following:

1. Translate interface. Take lib/l10n/app_en.arb and translate the values. Upload the translated file to lib/l10n/ and name it app_<language_code>.arb, for example app_de.arb
2. Translate recipes. Take assets/data/en folder and translate values for all the JSON files except brewing_methods.json. Don't translate placeholders, such as <final_water_amount> or <final_coffee_amount>, don't translate values for "brewing_method_id", "brew_time" and "is_favorite". Donâ€™t rename the files. Pay attention to decimal separators, it should always be decimal points, e.g. "0.6". Upload the translated files to assets/data/[new locale] folder.
3. Submit a PR.

A litte advice: it's okay to use the automatic translation (deepl, chatgpt, etc.) for the initial translation, but make sure to check for the readability and integrity and correct if needed. Also pay attention to placeholders and other translation rules.
