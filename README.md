## Translation  

If you want to contribute to app interface translation, there are 2 ways to do it:

1. Improve existing translation: find corresponding language file in [l10n](lib/l10n) folder, edit file and submit Pull Request, ideally with explanation of change.
2. Translate app to new language: fork repo, translate [base English .arb file](lib/l10n/app_en.arb), following the formatting, add new .arb file to l10n folder, submit pull request.

**Important**: Please don't edit .dart files in l10n folder, they're generated automatically during app build. Also, if you use LLMs for translation, please make sure to check correctness and consistency of translation.
