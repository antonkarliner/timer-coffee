I started developing this app because I brew a lot of coffee myself and I wanted to make the process more enjoyable. And I'm so glad that it's helpful not only for me, but for others as well! Thanks a lot for your support!

In this update: I recently brew a lot of recipes in different techniques, found little mistakes and typos and fixed them.
